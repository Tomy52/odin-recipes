            <li>4 (1/4 inch thick) slices red onion</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            <li>4 each Kaiser rolls, split</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Spray both sides of onion slices with cooking spray; set aside. Mix meat and 1/4 cup of the steak sauce; shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Grill patties 5 minutes; turn. Add onions to grill. Cook burgers an additional 5 minutes or until cooked through (160 degrees F), brushing occasionally with the remaining 1/4 cup steak sauce and turning onions after 3 min.</li>
